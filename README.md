## Introduction
The Yahtzee Multiplayer Game Analysis repository is an academic endeavor to build an efficient, robust, and interactive Yahtzee game in Python. It not only allows for multiplayer interaction but also includes statistical tools for analyzing gameplay. The project was developed using high-level programming constructs, adhering to PEP 8 standards, and implementing advanced data structures and algorithms for optimal performance.

## Technologies
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy for statistical analysis
- Pytest for unit testing

## Features
- **Multiplayer Interaction**: Allows multiple players to play interactively.
- **Robust Input Validation**: Utilizes Python’s typing module for strong type checking.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Includes a comprehensive suite of statistical tools to analyze gameplay, leveraging Python’s NumPy library.
- **Code Extensibility**: Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, facilitating future additions and improvements.
